#attendance folder for 11th september

Hey, I'm Naveen. I'm from India and am currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Engeneering in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kerala. I'm mainly a backend engineer but I've recently taken a shine to devops.
Looking forward to my time in the meshery community and making contributions
